This chapter provides instructions for installation and basic usage of the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

The Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library is delivered as a plugin to the Neo4j Graph Database.
The plugin needs to be installed into the database and whitelisted in the Neo4j configuration.
There are two main ways of achieving this, which we will detail in this chapter.


== Supported Neo4j versions

The GDS library supports the following Neo4j versions:

[opts=header]
|===
| Neo4j Graph Data Science | Neo4j version
.2+<.^|`1.4.x`
| `4.1.0` - `4.1.1`
| `4.0.0` - `4.0.8`
.2+<.^|`1.3.x`
| `4.1.0` - `4.1.1`
| `4.0.0` - `4.0.8`
| `1.2.3` footnote:deprecated[This version series is end-of-life and will not receive further patches. Please use a later version.]
| `4.0.0` - `4.0.6`
| `1.2.0` - `1.2.2` footnote:deprecated[]
| `4.0.0` - `4.0.4`
| `1.1.x`
| `3.5.9` - `3.5.21`
| `1.0.x` footnote:deprecated[]
| `3.5.9` - `3.5.18`
|===


== Neo4j Desktop

The most convenient way of installing the GDS library is through the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/neo4j-desktop/index.html[Neo4j Desktop^] plugin called Neo4j Graph Data Science.
The plugin can be found in the 'Plugins' tab of a database.

The installer will download the GDS library and install it in the 'plugins' directory of the database.
It will also add the following entry to the settings file:

----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----

This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.

If the procedure whitelist is configured, make sure to also include procedures from the GDS library:

----
dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=gds.*
----

== Neo4j Server

The GDS library is intended to be used on a standalone Neo4j server.

[NOTE]
====
Running the GDS library in a Neo4j Causal Cluster is not supported.
Read more about how to use GDS in conjunction with Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment <<installation-causal-cluster, below>>.
====

On a standalone Neo4j Server, the library will need to be installed and configured manually.

1. Download `neo4j-graph-data-science-[version]-standalone.jar` from the https://neo4j.com/download-center/[Neo4j Download Center] and copy it into the `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` directory.


2. Add the following to your `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=gds.*
----
This configuration entry is necessary because the GDS library accesses low-level components of Neo4j to maximise performance.
+

3. Check if the procedure whitelist is enabled in the `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` file and add the GDS library if necessary:
+
----
dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=gds.*
----
+

4. Restart Neo4j


=== Verifying installation

To verify your installation, the library version can be printed by entering into the browser in Neo4j Desktop and calling the `gds.version()` function:

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.version()
----

To list all installed algorithms, run the `gds.list()` procedure:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.list()
----


[[installation-causal-cluster]]
== Neo4j Causal Cluster

A Neo4j Causal Cluster consists of multiple machines that together support a highly available database management system.
The GDS library uses main memory on a single machine for hosting graphs in the graph catalog and computing algorithms over these.
These two architectures are not compatible and should not be used in conjunction.
A GDS workload will attempt to consume most of the system resources of the machine during runtime, which may make the machine unresponsive for extended periods of time.
For these reasons, we strongly advise against running GDS in a cluster as this potentially leads to data corruption or cluster outage.

To make use of GDS on graphs hosted by a Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment, these graphs should be detached from the running cluster.
This can be accomplished in several ways, including:

1. Dumping a snapshot of the Neo4j store and importing it in a separate standalone Neo4j server.
2. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and then detaching it to safely operate GDS on a snapshot in separation from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
3. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and configuring it for GDS workloads, which requires:
** installing GDS on the Read Replica
** managing cluster synchronisation events during GDS algorithm execution
** avoiding use of GDS write-back features
** consuming results from GDS workloads directly via Cypher

After the GDS workload has finished on a detached machine (for cases 1. and 2.) it now contains out-of-sync results written to its copied version of the graph from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
To integrate these results back to the cluster, custom programs are necessary.
