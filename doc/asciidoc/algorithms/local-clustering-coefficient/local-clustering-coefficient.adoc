[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-intro]]
== Introduction

The Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm computes the local clustering coefficient for each node in the graph.
The local clustering coefficient _C~n~_ of a node _n_ describes the likelihood that the neighbours of _n_ are also connected.
To compute _C~n~_ we use the number of triangles a node is a part of _T~n~_, and the degree of the node _d~n~_.
The formula to compute the local clustering coefficient is as follows:

image::lcc_formula.svg[align="center"]

As we can see the triangle count is required to compute the local clustering coefficient.
To do this the <<algorithms-triangle-count, Triangle Count>> algorithm is utilised.

Additionally, the algorithm can compute the _average clustering coefficient_ for the whole graph.
This is the normalised sum over all the local clustering coefficients.

[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples]]
== Examples

In this section we will show examples of executing the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm on a concrete graph.
The intention is to illustrate what the results look like and to provide a guide in how to make use of the algorithm in a real setting.
We will do this on a small social network graph of a handful of nodes connected in a particular pattern.
The example graph looks like this:

[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-graph]]
image::triangle_count.png[]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice'}),
  (michael:Person {name: 'Michael'}),
  (karin:Person {name: 'Karin'}),
  (chris:Person {name: 'Chris'}),
  (will:Person {name: 'Will'}),
  (mark:Person {name: 'Mark'}),

  (michael)-[:KNOWS]->(karin),
  (michael)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (will)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (mark)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (mark)-[:KNOWS]->(will),
  (alice)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (will)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (chris)-[:KNOWS]->(karin)
----

With the graph in Neo4j we can now project it into the graph catalog to prepare it for algorithm execution.
We do this using a native projection targeting the `Person` nodes and the `KNOWS` relationships.
For the relationships we must use the `UNDIRECTED` orientation.
This is because the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm is defined only for undirected graphs.

include::../shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will create a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'myGraph',
  'Person',
  {
    KNOWS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
)
----

WARNING: The Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm requires the graph to be created using the `UNDIRECTED` orientation for relationships.

In the following examples we will demonstrate using the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm on 'myGraph'.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-memory-estimation]]
=== Memory Estimation

:mode: write
include::../shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.write.estimate('myGraph', {
  writeProperty: 'localClusteringCoefficient'
})
YIELD nodeCount, relationshipCount, bytesMin, bytesMax, requiredMemory
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeCount | relationshipCount | bytesMin | bytesMax | requiredMemory
| 6         | 16                | 288      | 288      | "288 Bytes"
|===
--

Note that the relationship count is 16 although we only created 8 relationships in the original Cypher statement.
This is because we used the `UNDIRECTED` orientation, which will project each relationship in each direction, effectively doubling the number of relationships.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

:stream-details: For example, we can order the results to find the nodes with the highest local clustering coefficient.
include::../shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, localClusteringCoefficient
ORDER BY localClusteringCoefficient DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | localClusteringCoefficient
| "Karin"   | 1.0
| "Mark"    | 1.0
| "Chris"   | 0.6666666666666666
| "Will"    | 0.6666666666666666
| "Michael" | 0.3
| "Alice"   | 0.0
|===
--

From the results we can see that the nodes 'Karin' and 'Mark' have the highest local clustering coefficients.
This shows that they are the best at introducing their friends - all the people who know them, know each other!
This can be verified in the <<algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-graph, example graph>>.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-details: The summary result contains the avearage clustering coefficient of the graph, which is the normalised sum over all local clustering coefficients.
:stats-syntax: algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-syntax
include::../shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

.The following will run the algorithm in `stats` mode:
[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stats('myGraph')
YIELD averageClusteringCoefficient, nodeCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| averageClusteringCoefficient | nodeCount
| 0.6055555555555555           | 6
|===
--

The result shows that on average each node of our example graph has approximately 60% of its neighbours connected.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::../shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.mutate('myGraph', {
  mutateProperty: 'localClusteringCoefficient'
})
YIELD averageClusteringCoefficient, nodeCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| averageClusteringCoefficient | nodeCount
| 0.6055555555555555           | 6
|===
--

The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, the graph 'myGraph' now has a node property `localClusteringCoefficient` which stores the local clustering coefficient for each node.
To find out how to inspect the new schema of the in-memory graph, see <<catalog-graph-list>>.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::../shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `write` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.write('myGraph', {
  writeProperty: 'localClusteringCoefficient'
})
YIELD averageClusteringCoefficient, nodeCount
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| averageClusteringCoefficient | nodeCount
| 0.6055555555555555           | 6
|===
--

The returned result is the same as in the `stats` example.
Additionally, each of the six nodes now has a new property `localClusteringCoefficient` in the Neo4j database, containing the local clustering coefficient for that node.


[[algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-pre-computed]]
=== Pre-computed Counts

By default, the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm executes <<algorithms-triangle-count, Triangle Count>> as part of its computation.
It is also possible to avoid the triangle count computation by configuring the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm to read the triangle count from a node property.
In order to do that we specify the `triangleCountProperty` configuration parameter.
Please note that the Local Clustering Coefficient algorithm depends on the property holding actual triangle counts and not another number for the results to be actual local clustering coefficients.

To illustrate this we make use of the <<algorithms-triangle-count, Triangle Count algorithm>>
in `mutate` mode.
The Triangle Count algorithm is going to store its result back into 'myGraph'.
It is also possible to obtain the property value from the Neo4j database using a graph projection with a node property when creating the in-memory graph.

[role=query-example, no-result=true, group=triangleCountProperty]
--
.The following computes the triangle counts and stores the result into the in-memory graph:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.triangleCount.mutate('myGraph', {
  mutateProperty: 'triangles'
})
----
--

[role=query-example, group=triangleCountProperty]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using pre-computed triangle counts:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.localClusteringCoefficient.stream('myGraph', {
  triangleCountProperty: 'triangles'
})
YIELD nodeId, localClusteringCoefficient
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, localClusteringCoefficient
ORDER BY localClusteringCoefficient DESC
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | localClusteringCoefficient
| "Karin"   | 1.0
| "Mark"    | 1.0
| "Chris"   | 0.6666666666666666
| "Will"    | 0.6666666666666666
| "Michael" | 0.3
| "Alice"   | 0.0
|===
--

As we can see the results are the same as in <<algorithms-local-clustering-coefficient-examples-stream, the `stream` example>> where we did not specify a `triangleCountProperty`.
