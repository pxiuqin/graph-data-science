= Overlap Similarity

[abstract]
--
This section describes the Overlap Similarity algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient[Overlap similarity] measures overlap between two sets.
It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets, divided by the size of the smaller of the two sets.

[[algorithms-similarity-overlap-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Overlap similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::overlap.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// ```
// O(A,B) = (∣A ∩ B∣) / (min(∣A|,|B|))
// ```

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation, and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

// end::explanation[]

[[algorithms-similarity-overlap-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Overlap Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Overlap Similarity algorithm to work out which things are subsets of others.
We might then use these computed subsets to https://jbarrasa.com/2017/03/31/quickgraph5-learning-a-taxonomy-from-your-tagged-data/[learn a taxonomy from tagged data^], as described by Jesús Barrasa.

[[algorithms-similarity-overlap-function-sample]]
== Overlap Similarity algorithm function sample

.The following will return the Overlap similarity of two lists of numbers:
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.alpha.similarity.overlap([1,2,3], [1,2,4,5]) AS similarity

[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `similarity`
| 0.6666666666666666
|===
// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have an overlap similarity of 0.66.
We can see how this result is derived by breaking down the formula:

----
O(A,B) = (∣A ∩ B∣) / (min(∣A|,|B|))
O(A,B) = 2 / min(3,4)
       = 2 / 3
       = 0.66

// end::stream[]

Fantasy and Dystopia are both clear subgenres of Science Fiction - 100% of the books that list those as genres also list Science Fiction as a genre.
Dystopia is also a subgenre of Classics.
The others are less obvious; Dystopia probably isn't a subgenre of Fantasy, but the other two pairs could be subgenres.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.75, along with their intersection and overlap similarities:

We can see that those genres with lower similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` super genres for a given genre.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of genres, along with the two most similar super genres to them (i.e. `k=2`):
