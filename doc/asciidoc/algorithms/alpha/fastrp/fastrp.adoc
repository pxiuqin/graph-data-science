[abstract]
--
This section describes the Random Projection node embedding algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
--

Random Projection (fastrp), is a node embedding algorithm that uses very sparse random projections.
It iteratively constructs _intermediate_ embeddings by averaging neighboring embeddings.
Therefore, each node's embedding depends on a neighborhood of radius equal to the number of iterations.
This way Random Projection exploits higher-order relationships in the graph while still being highly scalable.

There are two aggregation methods that the algorithm can use.
The computed embeddings are aggregated from intermediate embeddings computed during the iterations.
One aggregation simply concatenates all the intermediate embeddings node by node.
The other aggregation computes the embeddings as a weighted sum of the intermediate embeddings.
The choice of aggregation method is made by specifying `iterationWeights` configuration parameters either as an empty list or containing the desired weights for the iterations.
In order to instead compute weighted averages of neighbouring embeddings, the `relationshipWeightProperty` parameter should be set to an existing relationship property.

NOTE: The algorithm is defined only for UNDIRECTED graphs.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the random nature of the algorithm the results will vary between the runs.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the pairwise distances of two node embeddings vary as much.
