[[algorithms-page-rank-intro]]
== Introduction

The PageRank algorithm measures the importance of each node within the graph, based on the number incoming relationships and the importance of the corresponding source nodes.
The underlying assumption roughly speaking is that a page is only as important as the pages that link to it.

PageRank is introduced in the original Google paper as a function that solves the following equation:

image::page-rank-formula.svg[align="center"]

where,

* we assume that a page _A_ has pages _T~1~_ to _T~n~_ which point to it.
* _d_ is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.
It is usually set to 0.85.
* _C(A)_ is defined as the number of links going out of page _A_.

This equation is used to iteratively update a candidate solution and arrive at an approximate solution to the same equation.

For more information on this algorithm, see:

* http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html[The original google paper^]
* http://delab.csd.auth.gr/~dimitris/courses/ir_spring06/page_rank_computing/01531136.pdf[An Efficient Partition-Based Parallel PageRank Algorithm^]
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5107.pdf[PageRank beyond the web^] for use cases

[NOTE]
====
Running this algorithm requires sufficient memory availability.
Before running this algorithm, we recommend that you read <<memory-estimation>>.

[[algorithms-page-rank-considerations]]
== Considerations

There are some things to be aware of when using the PageRank algorithm:

* If there are no links from within a group of pages to outside of the group, then the group is considered a spider trap.
* Rank sink can occur when a network of pages is forming an infinite cycle.
* Dead-ends occur when pages have no out-links.
If a page contains a link to another page which has no out-links, the link would be known as a dangling link.

Changing the value of damping factor can help with these considerations.
It can be interpreted as a probability of a web surfer to sometimes jump to a random page and therefore not getting stuck in sinks.

[[algorithms-page-rank-examples]]
== Examples

In this section we will show examples of executing the PageRank algorithm on a concrete graph.
The intention is to illustrate what the results look like and to provide a guide in how to make use of the algorithm in a real setting.
The example graph looks like this:

image::page-rank-graph.svg[align="center"]

.The following Cypher statement will create the example graph in the Neo4j database:
[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (home:Page {name:'Home'}),
  (about:Page {name:'About'}),
  (product:Page {name:'Product'}),
  (links:Page {name:'Links'}),
  (a:Page {name:'Site A'}),
  (b:Page {name:'Site B'}),
  (c:Page {name:'Site C'}),
  (d:Page {name:'Site D'}),

  (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.2}]->(about),
  (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.2}]->(links),
  (home)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.6}]->(product),
  (about)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (product)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (a)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (b)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (c)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (d)-[:LINKS {weight: 1.0}]->(home),
  (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.8}]->(home),
  (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(a),
  (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(b),
  (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(c),
  (links)-[:LINKS {weight: 0.05}]->(d);
----

This graph represents eight pages, linking to one another.
Each relationship has a property called `weight`, which describes the importance of the relationship.

include::../shared/examples-named-native-note.adoc[]

.The following statement will create a graph using a native projection and store it in the graph catalog under the name 'myGraph'.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
  'myGraph',
  'Page',
  'LINKS',
  {
    relationshipProperties: 'weight'
  }
)
----


[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-memory-estimation]]
=== Memory Estimation

:mode: write
include::../shared/examples-estimate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will estimate the memory requirements for running the algorithm:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.write.estimate('myGraph', {
  writeProperty: 'pageRank',
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85
})

[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-stream]]
=== Stream

:stream-details: For example, we can order the results to find the nodes with the highest PageRank score.
include::../shared/examples-stream-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph')
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 3.2362017153762284
| "About"   | 1.0611098567023873
| "Links"   | 1.0611098567023873
| "Product" | 1.0611098567023873
| "Site A"  | 0.3292259009438567
| "Site B"  | 0.3292259009438567
| "Site C"  | 0.3292259009438567
| "Site D"  | 0.3292259009438567
|===

The above query is running the algorithm in `stream` mode as `unweighted`.
Below is a <<algorithms-page-rank-examples-weighted, weighted example>>

NOTE: We are using `stream` mode to illustrate running the algorithm as `weighted` or `unweighted`, all the algorithm modes support this configuration parameter.

[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-stats]]
=== Stats

:stats-details: For example PageRank stats returns centrality histogram which can be used to monitor the distribution of PageRank score values across all computed nodes.
:stats-syntax: algorithms-page-rank-syntax
include::../shared/examples-stats-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and returns the result in form of statistical and measurement values
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stats('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85
})
YIELD centralityDistribution
RETURN centralityDistribution.max AS max
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| max
| 3.236204147338867
|===
--

The centrality histogram can be useful for inspecting the computed scores or perform normalizations.

[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-mutate]]
=== Mutate

include::../shared/examples-mutate-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `mutate` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.mutate('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85,
  mutateProperty: 'pagerank'
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten, ranIterations
----

| nodePropertiesWritten | ranIterations
| 8                     | 20
|===
--


[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-write]]
=== Write

include::../shared/examples-write-intro.adoc[]

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `write` mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.write('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85,
  writeProperty: 'pagerank'
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten, ranIterations
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1m,1m"]
|===
| nodePropertiesWritten | ranIterations
| 8                     | 20
|===
--


[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-weighted]]
=== Weighted

By default, the algorithm is considering the relationships of the graph to be `unweighted`, to change this behaviour we can use configuration parameter called `relationshipWeightProperty`.
Below is an example of running the algorithm using this property.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using relationship weights:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85,
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight'
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 3.5528567278757683
| "Product" | 1.9541301048360766
| "About"   | 0.7513767024036497
| "Links"   | 0.7513767024036497
| "Site A"  | 0.18167360233856014
| "Site B"  | 0.18167360233856014
| "Site C"  | 0.18167360233856014
| "Site D"  | 0.18167360233856014
|===
--

NOTE: We are using `stream` mode to illustrate running the algorithm as `weighted` or `unweighted`, all the algorithm modes support this configuration parameter.


[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-tolerance]]
=== Tolerance

The `tolerance` configuration parameter denotes the minimum change in scores between iterations.
If all scores change less than the configured `tolerance` value the result stabilises, and the algorithm returns.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using bigger `tolerance` value:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85,
  tolerance: 0.1
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 2.8504480060189965
| "About"   | 0.9325180530548096
| "Links"   | 0.9325180530548096
| "Product" | 0.9325180530548096
| "Site A"  | 0.3035158541286364
| "Site B"  | 0.3035158541286364
| "Site C"  | 0.3035158541286364
| "Site D"  | 0.3035158541286364
|===
--

In this example we are using `tolerance: 0.1`, so the results are a bit different compared to the ones from <<algorithms-page-rank-examples-stream, stream example>> which is using the default value of `tolerance`.
Note that the nodes 'About', 'Link' and 'Product' now have the same score, while with the default value of `tolerance` the node 'Product' has higher score than the other two.


[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-damping]]
=== Damping Factor

The damping factor configuration parameter accepts values between 0 and 1.
If its value is too high then problems of sinks and spider traps may occur, and the values may oscillate so that the algorithm does not converge.
If it's too low then all scores are pushed towards 1, and the result will not sufficiently reflect the structure of the graph.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm in `stream` mode using smaller `dampingFactor` value:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.05
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 1.248730954737198
| "About"   | 0.9708121816856135
| "Links"   | 0.9708121816856135
| "Product" | 0.9708121816856135
| "Site A"  | 0.9597081215046129
| "Site B"  | 0.9597081215046129
| "Site C"  | 0.9597081215046129
| "Site D"  | 0.9597081215046129
|===
--

Compared to the results from the <<algorithms-page-rank-examples-stream, stream example>> which is using the default value of `dampingFactor` the score values are closer to each other when using `dampingFactor: 0.05`.
Also, note that the nodes 'About', 'Link' and 'Product' now have the same score, while with the default value of `dampingFactor` the node 'Product' has higher score than the other two.

[[algorithms-page-rank-examples-personalised]]
=== Personalised PageRank


Personalized PageRank is a variation of PageRank which is biased towards a set of `sourceNodes`.
This variant of PageRank is often used as part of https://www.r-bloggers.com/from-random-walks-to-personalized-pagerank/[recommender systems^].

The following examples show how to run PageRank centered around 'Site A'.

[role=query-example]
--
.The following will run the algorithm and stream results:
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (siteA:Page {name: 'Site A'})
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('myGraph', {
  maxIterations: 20,
  dampingFactor: 0.85,
  sourceNodes: [siteA]
})
YIELD nodeId, score
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, score
ORDER BY score DESC, name ASC
----

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
| name      | score
| "Home"    | 0.4015879109501838
| "Site A"  | 0.1690742586266424
| "About"   | 0.11305649263085797
| "Links"   | 0.11305649263085797
| "Product" | 0.11305649263085797
| "Site B"  | 0.01907425862664241
| "Site C"  | 0.01907425862664241
| "Site D"  | 0.01907425862664241
|===
--

Comparing these results to the ones from the <<algorithms-page-rank-examples-stream, stream example>> (which is not using `sourceNodes` configuration parameter) shows that the 'Site A' node  that we used in the `sourceNodes` list now scores second instead of fourth.
