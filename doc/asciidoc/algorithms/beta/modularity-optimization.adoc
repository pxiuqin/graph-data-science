== Introduction

The Modularity Optimization algorithm tries to detect communities in the graph based on their _modularity_.
_Modularity_ is a measure of the structure of a graph, measuring the density of connections within a module or community.
Graphs with a high modularity score will have many connections within a community but only few pointing outwards to other communities.
The algorithm will explore for every node if its modularity score might increase if it changes its community to one of its neighboring nodes.

The configuration for the `mutate` mode is similar to the `write` mode.
Instead of specifying a `writeProperty`, we need to specify a `mutateProperty`.
Also, specifying `writeConcurrency` is not possible in `mutate` mode.

.The following will run the algorithm and store the results in `myGraph`:

[[algorithms-modularity-optimization-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:Person {name:'Alice'})
, (b:Person {name:'Bridget'})
, (c:Person {name:'Charles'})
, (d:Person {name:'Doug'})
, (e:Person {name:'Elton'})
, (f:Person {name:'Frank'})
, (a)-[:KNOWS {weight: 0.01}]->(b)
, (a)-[:KNOWS {weight: 5.0}]->(e)
, (a)-[:KNOWS {weight: 5.0}]->(f)
, (b)-[:KNOWS {weight: 5.0}]->(c)
, (b)-[:KNOWS {weight: 5.0}]->(d)
, (c)-[:KNOWS {weight: 0.01}]->(e)
, (f)-[:KNOWS {weight: 0.01}]->(d)
----

This graph consists of two center nodes "Alice" and "Bridget" each of which have two more neighbors.
Additionally, each neighbor of "Alice" is connected to one of the neighbors of "Bridget".
Looking at the weights of the relationships, it can be seen that the connections from the two center nodes to their neighbors are very strong, while connections between those groups are weak.
Therefore the Modularity Optimization algorithm should detect two communities: "Alice" and "Bob" together with their neighbors respectively.


[NOTE]
====
In the examples below we will use named graphs and standard projections as the norm.
However, <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> and anonymous graphs could also be used.
====

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'myGraph',
    'Person',
    {
        KNOWS: {
            type: 'KNOWS',
            orientation: 'UNDIRECTED',
            properties: ['weight']
        }
    })
----

The following example demonstrates using the Modularity Algorithm on this weighted graph.

[role=query-example]
--
.Running the Modularity Optimization algorithm in stream mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.modularityOptimization.stream('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight' })
YIELD nodeId, communityId
RETURN gds.util.asNode(nodeId).name AS name, communityId
ORDER BY name
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| name      | communityId
| "Alice"   | 4
| "Bridget" | 1
| "Charles" | 1
| "Doug"    | 1
| "Elton"   | 4
| "Frank"   | 4
|===
--

It is also possible to write the assigned community ids back to the database using the `write` mode.

[role=query-example]
--
.Running the Modularity Optimization algorithm in write mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.modularityOptimization.write('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight', writeProperty: 'community' })
YIELD nodes, communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodes | communityCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 6     | 2              | 3             | true
|===
--

When using `write` mode the procedure will return information about the algorithm execution.
In this example we return the number of processed nodes, the number of communities assigned to the nodes in the graph, the number of iterations and information whether the algorithm converged.

Running the algorithm without specifying the `relationshipWeightProperty` will default all relationship weights to 1.0.

To instead mutate the in-memory graph with the assigned community ids, the `mutate` mode is used.

[role=query-example]
--
.Running the Modularity Optimization algorithm in mutate mode:
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.beta.modularityOptimization.mutate('myGraph', { relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight', mutateProperty: 'community' })
YIELD nodes, communityCount, ranIterations, didConverge
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodes | communityCount | ranIterations | didConverge
| 6     | 2              | 3             | true
|===
--

When using `mutate` mode the procedure will return information about the algorithm execution as in `write` mode.
