/**
 * A class for compressing and decompressing {@code double}s.
 *
 * There are various methods for compressing either a single double, or multiple ones in one call.
 * Similar methods exist for decompression.
 * The compression itself is identical for all those methods.
 * The difference they provide is in how much reuse of buffer data structures is allowed.
 *
 * Implementors need to implement only {@link #compressDouble(long,byte[],int)} for compressing
 * and {@link #decompressDouble(byte[],int,MutableDouble)} for decompressing. The other methods
 * for compression or decompression can be override if a better implementation can be provided.
 *
 * In addition, {@link #compressedSize(byte[], int)} must provide the number of bytes for a certain compressed value.
 * This is required as many decompressing methods to not offer feedback on how much data they've read.
 *
 * For testing and debug purposes, implementors need to provide {@link #describeCompressedValue(byte[], int, double)}.
 * The value that is returned from {@link DoubleCodec.CompressionInfo#compressedType()}
 * is used to call {@link #describeCompression(int)} so that one should be implemented accordingly.
